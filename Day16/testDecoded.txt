The three bits labeled V (001) are the packet version, 1.
The three bits labeled T (110) are the packet type ID, 6, which means the packet is an operator.
The bit labeled I (0) is the length type ID, which indicates that the length is a 15-bit number representing the number of bits in the sub-packets.
The 15 bits labeled L (000000000011011) contain the length of the sub-packets in bits, 27.
The 11 bits labeled A contain the first sub-packet, a literal value representing the number 10.
The 16 bits labeled B contain the second sub-packet, a literal value representing the number 20.

represents an operator packet (version 4) which contains an 
operator packet (version 1) which contains an operator packet (version 5) 
which contains a literal value (version 6); this packet has a version sum of 16.

620080001611562C8802118E34 
represents an operator packet (version 3) 
which contains two sub-packets; each sub-packet is an operator packet 
that contains two literal values. This packet has a version sum of 12.

C0015000016115A2E0802F182340 
has the same structure as the previous 
example, but the outermost packet uses a different length type ID. 
This packet has a version sum of 23.

A0016C880162017C3686B18A3D4780
 is an operator packet that contains an 
operator packet that contains an operator packet that contains five 
literal values; it has a version sum of 31.
